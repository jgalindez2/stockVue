# Stock Trading App

> This is a simple app for Stock Trading :moneybag: built with
[vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html)

## Resume

This project was created with a lot a features of vue.js and vuex, the main
logic of this project is created with vuex, share the information of the stocks
between components was good a challenge. So, I created a vuex store for the app
where there are modules, actions and the index file.

I also make beautiful transitions between the components, It was easy it with
vue transitions. In the stocks view all the stocks have a transition, you can
watch it when you select a filter.

Let me know your suggestion and I hope you like the app, It was made
with :hearts: by me.
